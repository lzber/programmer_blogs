# 11月的随想
当船块要沉了，慌忙中想到的就是赶紧把不重要的丢到海里去，活命要紧。  
这正是我11月末的写照。  
如果我传递了负能量，对不起，我真的很抱歉，我也想做一个爱笑的人，充满正能量的人，让大家都觉得我快快乐乐的，阳光而有信心，给团队信息，但是现在，我要说说我真实的想法。 

如果说为什么要写作？  
那就是因为想不开，难受，沮丧，郁闷。  

[TODO:]给自己开脱，但是咱现在说点现实的吧。  
1. 我有一笔很大的知识负债，入学三个月以来，尽管我小心谨慎，还是因为学习方法不当，目标不明确，造成长期吊车尾。明明已经很努力了，可能是假努力，每天都坐在图书馆，但是作业还是有很多不会做。  
经常调侃自己是个菜狗，如今期末来了，总要想个办法对付。  
我这学期有5门课，也才5门课，但是展开来我真的觉得要学的还挺多的。  
1.云计算  
2.移动开发  
3.操作系统  
4.Java  
5.软件需求工程   

回到学校之前，我想我一定要当个学霸，现在看来，我是个学弱。  
虽然也参加了一点学生会工作，但是也不是很忙，比起很多人，导师每周开组会，我真的压力不是很大，时间还算充足，可是我就是写不完自己的作业。  

准确的说，是不会写。  
算法我好久都没刷了，刷一道就忘了，干脆就没刷了，那个每日刷算法的群坚持了4个月，反反复复的也退了。  

我分析一下这5门课吧。  
云计算，是一些纯理论的课。 以学习概念为主，多数时间讲理论，少数时间课堂小作业。
移动开发，我是在开学选课结束前一晚上补选上的，因为一开始不想上这门课，所以前两周没有去上这门课。然后当时也不想买课本，磨磨唧唧，当时十月也特别混，然后就写那个作业小项目特别慢，体验了装环境的痛苦。  

# 关于Wikibook
0.1.1 What is Wikibooks?
Started in 2003 as an offshoot of the popular Wikipedia
project, Wikibooks is a free, collaborative wiki website
dedicated to creating high-quality textbooks and other educational books for students around the world. In addition to English, Wikibooks is available in over 130 languages, a complete listing of which can be found at http:
//www.wikibooks.org. Wikibooks is a “wiki”, which
means anybody can edit the content there at any time.
If you find an error or omission in this book, you can
log on to Wikibooks to make corrections and additions
as necessary. All of your changes go live on the website
immediately, so your effort can be enjoyed and utilized
by other readers and editors without delay.
Books at Wikibooks are written by volunteers, and can
be accessed and printed for free from the website. Wikibooks is operated entirely by donations, and a certain portion of proceeds from sales is returned to the Wikimedia
Foundation to help keep Wikibooks running smoothly.
Because of the low overhead, we are able to produce and
sell books for much cheaper then proprietary textbook
publishers can. This book can be edited by anybody at
any time, including you. We don't make you wait two
years to get a new edition, and we don't stop selling old
versions when a new one comes out.
Note that Wikibooks is not a publisher of books, and
is not responsible for the contributions of its volunteer
editors. PediaPress.com is a print-on-demand publisher
that is also not responsible for the content that it prints.
Please see our disclaimer for more information: http://
en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:General_disclaimer .
0.1.2 What is this book?
This book was generated by the volunteers at Wikibooks,
a team of people from around the world with varying
backgrounds. The people who wrote this book may not
be experts in the field. Some may not even have a passing
familiarity with it. The result of this is that some information in this book may be incorrect, out of place, or
misleading. For this reason, you should never rely on a
community-edited Wikibook when dealing in matters of
medical, legal, financial, or other importance. Please see
our disclaimer for more details on this.
Despite the warning of the last paragraph, however, books
at Wikibooks are continuously edited and improved. If
errors are found they can be corrected immediately. If
you find a problem in one of our books, we ask that you
be bold in fixing it. You don't need anybody’s permission
to help or to make our books better.
Wikibooks runs off the assumption that many eyes can
find many errors, and many able hands can fix them. Over
time, with enough community involvement, the books at
Wikibooks will become very high-quality indeed. You
are invited to participate at Wikibooks to help make
our books better. As you find problems in your book
don't just complain about them: Log on and fix them!
This is a kind of proactive and interactive reading experience that you probably aren't familiar with yet, so log
on to http://en.wikibooks.org and take a look around at
all the possibilities. We promise that we won't bite!
0.1.3 Who are the authors?
The volunteers at Wikibooks come from around the
world and have a wide range of educational and professional backgrounds. They come to Wikibooks for different reasons, and perform different tasks. Some Wikibookians are prolific authors, some are perceptive editors, some fancy illustrators, others diligent organizers.
Some Wikibookians find and remove spam, vandalism,
and other nonsense as it appears. Most Wikibookians
perform a combination of these jobs.
It’s difficult to say who are the authors for any particular book, because so many hands have touched it and so
many changes have been made over time. It’s not unheard
of for a book to have been edited thousands of times by
hundreds of authors and editors. You could be one of them
too, if you're interested in helping out.
0.1.4 Wikibooks in Class
Books at Wikibooks are free, and with the proper editing and preparation they can be used as cost-effective
textbooks in the classroom or for independent learners.
In addition to using a Wikibook as a traditional readonly learning aide, it can also become an interactive class
2 CONTENTS
project. Several classes have come to Wikibooks to write
new books and improve old books as part of their normal course work. In some cases, the books written by
students one year are used to teach students in the same
class next year. Books written can also be used in classes
around the world by students who might not be able to
afford traditional textbooks.
0.1.5 Happy Reading!
We at Wikibooks have put a lot of effort into these books,
and we hope that you enjoy reading and learning from
them. We want you to keep in mind that what you are
holding is not a finished product but instead a work in
progress. These books are never “finished” in the traditional sense, but they are ever-changing and evolving to
meet the needs of readers and learners everywhere. Despite this constant change, we feel our books can be reliable and high-quality learning tools at a great price, and
we hope you agree. Never hesitate to stop in at Wikibooks and make some edits of your own. We hope to see
you there one day. Happy reading!

曾经我也有这个想法，中文也有，但是影响力不够大。现在我想回过头来再审视一下这个想法。
